# Cloud Security Project (2024)

This repository contains my work for a cloud security project at Kristiania University College.  
The project focused on designing a hybrid cloud architecture, exploring regulatory compliance, and performing hands-on cloud security tasks.

## Overview

- **Hybrid Cloud Design**: Designed a hybrid cloud model for a consulting company expanding to the US and Germany, using Azure regions for scalability and compliance.  
- **Regulatory Analysis**: Researched GDPR, NIS Directive, and US Federal/State compliance requirements.  
- **Security Plan**: Created a plan based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).  
- **Technical Labs**:
  - Installed and configured Ubuntu VM  
  - Checked system CPU and open ports  
  - Installed and configured Nginx web server  
  - Simulated DDoS attacks using `ab` (Apache Benchmark)  
  - Monitored performance with `htop`  
  - Installed Docker and repeated tests in a containerized environment  

## Key Learnings

- Designing **hybrid cloud architectures** for flexibility and compliance  
- Hands-on experience with **Nginx**, **Docker**, and **load testing**  
- Practical knowledge of **incident response** and **business continuity planning**  
- Using **Azure governance tools** to manage complexity  

## Tools and Technologies

- Microsoft Azure  
- Nginx  
- Docker  
- Apache Benchmark (`ab`)  
- Ubuntu VM  
- NIST CSF & CSA Cloud Security Guidance
