# Hybrid Cloud Expansion and Security Strategy

## Problem Statement

How can an IT consulting company with a growing global presence in Europe, the United States, and Germany design a hybrid cloud architecture that supports large scale IoT analytics, keeps data residency, and maintains security, scalability, and business continuity?

## Approach

To answer this, the project explored:
- Expanding Azure regions for improved latency and data residency
- Designing a hybrid cloud model that links an existing private cloud in Amsterdam with Azure public cloud
- Using Azure IoT Hub for secure and scalable device to cloud communication and analytics
- Reviewing GDPR, NIS, and United States privacy and security laws for compliance
- Building a security plan aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Creating a secure software development lifecycle training plan for developers and architects

## Key Trade Offs

- **Security and Compliance:** Balance regional privacy laws and cross border transfers, such as GDPR with SCC or BCR for transfers to the United States, and local rules in Germany
- **Cost Management:** Operating both private and public cloud adds cost for compute, storage, and bandwidth, so capacity planning matters
- **Operational Complexity:** Governance, standardization, and monitoring across environments require clear roles and controls

## Recommended Solution

### Hybrid Cloud Design
- Keep sensitive data in the private cloud for compliance
- Run compute heavy IoT analytics in Azure public cloud for elasticity
- Use traffic distribution across regions to reduce latency and improve resilience

### Compliance Strategy
- Maintain GDPR compliance, and where needed appoint a Data Protection Officer in Germany
- Use SCC or BCR for transfers to the United States when needed
- Align operations with relevant United States federal and state privacy and security rules

### Security and Governance
- Enforce guardrails with Azure Policy across subscriptions and regions
- Use role based access control and multi factor authentication
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Centralize logs and events and use a SIEM for continuous monitoring

### Business Continuity and Risk
- Use geo redundancy for critical IoT data and services
- Define recovery time objective and recovery point objective for key functions
- Test disaster recovery on a schedule and review cloud provider service level agreements

### Secure Development Lifecycle
- Apply secure design principles such as least privilege and defense in depth
- Use OWASP Top Ten as a coding reference for common issues
- Automate static and dynamic security testing in the pipeline

## Conclusion

A hybrid cloud model on Azure gives flexibility to scale IoT services globally while keeping control over sensitive data. With a clear compliance plan, strong governance, and a secure development lifecycle, the company can expand with confidence and keep services available during incidents.
